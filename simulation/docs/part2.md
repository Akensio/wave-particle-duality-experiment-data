# Diffraction of Non-Monochromatic Wave Pulses through a Diffraction Grating

## Wave Equation Framework and Analytical Solutions

Maxwell’s Equations and the Wave Equation: Electromagnetic wave diffraction can be derived from fundamental principles. Maxwell’s equations (in source-free, homogeneous media) lead to the wave equation for the electric field $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t)$:

$$\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} - \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2} = 0,$$

with $c$ the speed of light. In the frequency domain, this becomes the Helmholtz equation $(\nabla^2 + k^2)\mathbf{E}_0 = 0$ for monochromatic components of wavenumber $k=2\pi/\lambda$. These wave equations predict diffraction whenever a wave is limited by an aperture or obstacle – only an infinite plane wave can propagate without spreading, but any wave with finite extent must spread out as it travels. This spreading and interference of waves is the origin of diffraction patterns, and it can be calculated directly from the wave equation using appropriate boundary conditions.

### Diffraction Grating Setup

A diffraction grating is an optical element with a periodic structure (e.g. a series of parallel slits or grooves). When a plane wave is incident on a grating, the periodic boundary conditions cause the outgoing (scattered) field to decompose into discrete plane-wave modes (diffracted orders). Mathematically, one can solve the Helmholtz equation with a periodic boundary condition (Floquet condition) at the grating surface, yielding solutions of the form $E \sim \exp[i(k_x x + k_z z)]$ where $k_x$ differs by multiples of the grating’s reciprocal periodicity. The condition for constructive interference between waves from adjacent grating elements leads to the grating equation:

$$d\,(\sin\theta_m \pm \sin\theta_i) = m\,\lambda,$$

where $d$ is the grating period (spacing between slits or grooves), $\theta_i$ is the angle of incidence, $\theta_m$ is the diffraction angle for the $m$-th order (an integer $m$ can be positive, negative, or zero for different diffraction orders), and $\lambda$ is the wavelength. For simplicity, at normal incidence $\theta_i=0$, this reduces to $d,\sin\theta_m = m,\lambda$. This formula is an analytical result giving the directions $\theta_m$ in which constructive interference (maxima of diffracted intensity) occur for a monochromatic wave. It shows that different wavelengths $\lambda$ will satisfy the condition at different angles $\theta_m$, which is the basis of how gratings disperse light.

### Huygens–Fresnel Principle and Kirchhoff Integral

The grating can be analyzed by treating each point on each slit as a secondary source (Huygens’ principle). The total field at a distant observation point is the superposition of contributions from all these sources, with relative phases determined by the path differences. Formally, the Kirchhoff diffraction formula (derived from the wave equation via Green’s functions) gives the field in the far zone as an integral over the aperture of the form:

$$ U(p) \;\propto\; \iint_{\text{aperture}} E_{\text{inc}}(x,y,0)\, G(x,y)\, e^{\,i k (x \sin\theta + y \sin\phi)}\,dx\,dy, $$

where $E_{\text{inc}}(x,y,0)$ is the incident field on the grating plane ($z=0$), $G(x,y)$ represents the grating’s transmission or reflection function (periodic in $x$ for a line grating), and $(\theta,\phi)$ are the angles in the far field (direction cosines $l=\sin\theta$, $m=\sin\phi$). In the far field (Fraunhofer regime), this integral simplifies to a Fourier transform: the diffracted field is essentially the Fourier transform of the aperture function (incident field times grating mask). In other words,

$$U(\theta,\phi) \propto \mathcal{F}\{E_{\text{inc}}(x,y)\,G(x,y)\},$$

so the angular distribution of outgoing waves is given by the Fourier spectrum of the field immediately after the grating. For a plane-wave illumination ($E_{\text{inc}}$ constant across the grating), the diffraction pattern is basically the transform of $G(x,y)$ alone. In the case of an ideal periodic grating with many slits, this Fourier transform consists of a comb of sharp peaks at the discrete grating orders (satisfying the grating equation), modulated by the envelope of a single-slit diffraction pattern. In fact, the pattern can be viewed as a convolution of the single-slit diffraction (which gives the broad envelope) with the multi-slit interference pattern (a comb of delta-functions for an infinite, periodic grating).

### Closed-Form Solutions

In favorable cases, one can obtain closed-form analytical expressions for the diffraction pattern. For example, a grating of $N$ identical slits each of width $a$ yields a far-field intensity:

$$I(\theta) \;=\; I_0 \left(\frac{\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\right)^2 \left(\frac{\sin(N\beta)}{\sin\beta}\right)^2,$$

where $\alpha = \frac{\pi a}{\lambda}\sin\theta$ (from single-slit diffraction) and $\beta = \frac{\pi d}{\lambda}\sin\theta$ (from the $N$-slit interference). This formula, derived by summing $N$ wave contributions, shows sharp principal maxima at the grating equation angles $d\sin\theta = m\lambda$ (from the $\sin(N\beta)/\sin\beta$ term) and a sinc-squared envelope from each slit. Such closed-form results come from applying the Fraunhofer approximation (far field) and idealizing the aperture shape. In general, the Fraunhofer diffraction equation often permits analytical solutions for simple apertures. However, the exact Kirchhoff integral (which is based on the full wave equation without the far-field approximation) usually does not have a simple closed-form solution for arbitrary grating shapes. In other words, aside from special cases (simple geometries, far-field conditions), solving Maxwell’s wave equations for a diffraction grating yields complicated integrals that must be evaluated numerically or approximated. Nonetheless, using the wave equation approach assures that diffraction is fully explained by fundamental principles (no purely empirical assumption) – historically, diffraction was observed first and later formulated in wave theory, but now we understand that the wave equation alone predicts diffraction patterns correctly.

## Fourier Representation of Pulses and Superposition

### Wave Packets and Frequency Decomposition

A non-monochromatic wave pulse (for example, a short laser pulse or a flash of white light) can be thought of as a wave packet – a superposition of many sinusoidal components of different frequencies (wavelengths). Mathematically, any pulse can be decomposed by a Fourier transform into its frequency spectrum. We can write an incident pulse (for simplicity, one polarization and one spatial dimension) as:

$$E_{\text{in}}(x,t) \;=\; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \tilde{E}(x,\omega)\, e^{-i\omega t}\,d\omega,$$

where $\tilde{E}(x,\omega)$ are the complex amplitudes of each frequency component. Because the underlying wave equations are linear, each frequency component propagates and diffracts independently according to the monochromatic (Helmholtz equation) theory discussed above. The grating thus acts linearly on each Fourier component of the pulse. Specifically, for each frequency $\omega$ (wavelength $\lambda=2\pi c/\omega$), the grating will produce diffraction orders at angles given by the grating equation. In the time domain, this means the grating causes the original pulse to split into a set of pulses or beams, each corresponding to a different diffraction order and containing a particular spectral band of the original. The overall field at some observation point is then the superposition (integral) of the contributions from all the spectral components that reach that point.

Separation of Wavelength Components: A diffraction grating inherently causes different wavelengths in a broadband pulse to go in different directions. The outgoing light is angularly dispersed by wavelength – each wavelength of the input is sent into a different direction, producing a rainbow of colors under white-light illumination. This is analogous to a prism creating a spectrum, though the mechanism differs (a prism uses material dispersion, while a grating uses interference). In effect, the grating performs a Fourier decomposition spatially: the far-field pattern is the spectral content laid out at different angles. For example, a diffraction grating will spatially separate a femtosecond pulse into its spectral components – shorter wavelengths (blue) exit at a different angle than longer wavelengths (red) for a given diffraction order. This property is exploited in spectrometers and pulse shapers.

### Illustration

An argon-ion laser beam with multiple discrete wavelengths (458 nm, 476 nm, 488 nm, 497 nm, 502 nm, 515 nm) is diffracted by a grating into separate beams, one for each wavelength. The $m=0$ order (undeflected) is in the center, while the first-order diffracted beams (to left and right) show distinct colors. This demonstrates how a non-monochromatic input can be decomposed by a grating into its constituent spectral components, each propagating in a different direction.

Because each frequency travels in its own direction, an ultrashort input pulse no longer remains a single collocated pulse after the grating – instead, its energy is distributed among the various diffracted beams, each of which might be longer in time or shifted in time relative to the others (as discussed next). If one desires to reconstitute the original pulse, one could send those separated spectral components through a second “inverse” grating setup to recombine them (this is how pulse stretchers/compressors work, essentially performing a Fourier transform and then an inverse transform with some phase adjustments). But if the beams are left separated, the grating has effectively performed a Fourier transform of the pulse: the information about the pulse’s spectrum is now mapped to spatial angles and can be analyzed (for example, capturing the diffracted light on a screen or camera would allow one to measure the spectrum as the intensity vs angle).

## Dispersion and Pulse Propagation Considerations

### Wavelength-Dependent Phase Velocity

In free space all colors travel at the same speed $c$, but when a grating diffracts the pulse, different spectral components emerge along different directions. If we consider one particular diffraction order (say the first-order beam at angle $\theta_m(\lambda)$), the optical path length from the grating to a far-field point will generally differ for different $\lambda$ because of geometry. Equivalently, the phase delay introduced by the grating to reach a certain reference plane varies with frequency. We can characterize the grating’s effect on each frequency by a phase transfer function $\phi(\omega)$ (for a given diffraction order and propagation distance). For a narrowband pulse, $\phi(\omega)$ can be expanded in a Taylor series around the central frequency $\omega_0$:

$$\phi(\omega) \approx \phi(\omega_0) + \phi{\prime}(\omega_0)\,(\omega-\omega_0) + \frac{1}{2}\phi{\prime}{\prime}(\omega_0)\,(\omega-\omega_0)^2 + \cdots,$$

where $\phi’(\omega_0) = d\phi/d\omega$ is the group delay (time delay experienced by the pulse’s envelope) and $\phi’’(\omega_0)$ is the group-delay dispersion (GDD) which causes pulse stretching. In essence, $\phi’(\omega_0)$ tells how the arrival time of that spectral component is shifted, and $\phi’’(\omega_0)$ (and higher terms) tell how the pulse is broadened and chirped (frequency chirp meaning a time-varying instantaneous frequency) due to the grating. For a diffraction grating in air, the primary source of dispersion is geometric: higher-frequency (shorter $\lambda$) components diffraction at different angles and thus may travel different distances to a detector or recombination point than lower-frequency components. If the diffracted beams are recombined (for instance, by mirrors or a second grating), the net effect is that the output pulse can be temporally chirped (different colors arrive at different times) unless special care is taken. In fact, grating pairs are commonly used to control dispersion in ultrafast laser systems: a parallel grating pair introduces negative GDD, meaning higher frequencies (blue) arrive earlier than lower frequencies (red) in the recombined pulse. By adjusting distances, one can stretch a pulse (adding positive dispersion) or compress a pulse (adding negative dispersion) to counteract material dispersion.

Even with a single grating and no explicit recombination optics, one can observe dispersion effects. If you look at one diffraction order and focus it onto a distant screen, the different wavelengths arrive at different lateral positions on the screen (spatial separation). But if you were to sample the field at one fixed spatial point in that diffracted beam, effectively you’d be picking out a narrow band of wavelengths (since only one color goes exactly through that point). In practice, an ultrashort pulse after a grating will often appear longer in time when observed in any one output direction because it has been spectrally filtered by that direction. For example, selecting a very narrow range of angles out of the diffracted light is equivalent to applying a narrowband frequency filter to the pulse, which causes it to “ring” longer in time (the classic Fourier transform effect of a sharp frequency filter producing a long temporal tail). In general, the broader the spectrum, the shorter the pulse; conversely, if you isolate a narrow slice of the spectrum (as a grating does at a given angle), the pulse duration lengthens. Thus, dispersion in the context of gratings usually refers to the pulse being delayed, stretched, and chirped due to the wavelength-dependent diffraction path. The first-order term $\phi’$ might simply delay the whole pulse (which is often unimportant for a single pulse), but the second-order term $\phi’’$ will broaden the pulse (different frequency components separate in time). Higher-order dispersion can distort the pulse shape. In summary, after passing through a grating (or grating pair), a short pulse may:
	•	Acquire a time delay relative to its original emission (path length difference),
	•	Broaden in duration (if the spectrum is spread out and not all components arrive simultaneously),
	•	Develop chirp (a systematic variation of frequency in time across the pulse).

All these effects can be quantified by analyzing $\phi(\omega)$ or equivalently by computing the output pulse $E_{\text{out}}(t)$ via the inverse Fourier transform $E_{\text{out}}(t) = \int \tilde{E}_{\text{in}}(\omega),H(\omega),e^{-i\omega t}d\omega$, where $H(\omega)=e^{i\phi(\omega)}$ is the grating’s transfer function. In practice, optical designers often use the known grating equation to find angles and then use ray optics or Fourier methods to calculate $\phi(\omega)$ for a given geometry. The key point is that each wavelength travels at its own angle, so if those wavelengths are later brought to focus or made to overlap, they will not all be in step unless the geometry is symmetric or corrected. (For instance, the classic Treacy compressor uses two gratings in sequence such that the angular dispersion is reversed, and in that process, it introduces a controlled delay as a function of wavelength.)

### Example – Parallel Grating Pair

To give a concrete example of dispersion: a pair of parallel diffraction gratings separated by a distance $s$ can introduce a large group delay dispersion. The round-trip through the pair causes higher-frequency components to travel a longer path than lower-frequency ones (or vice versa, depending on geometry). The resulting chirp can stretch a femtosecond pulse to picoseconds. The group-delay dispersion $D_2$ (second derivative of delay vs. frequency) for two gratings can be derived analytically and is found to be negative in the typical configuration (meaning blue light exits before red light). This is useful for compressing pulses that were positively chirped in an amplifier (as in Chirped Pulse Amplification systems). While this is a specific case, it illustrates how diffraction coupled with propagation leads to frequency-dependent timing. In general, whenever dealing with broadband pulses, one must account for the fact that a grating will angularly disperse the spectrum and potentially introduce temporal dispersion (if those angles are later converted into path length differences).

## Edge Cases and Numerical Methods

Limits of Analytical Solutions: As noted, simple analytical formulas (like the grating equation and Fraunhofer patterns) assume ideal conditions: infinite periodic structure, far-field observation, uniform illumination, etc. In more complex or edge cases, closed-form solutions may fail. The Kirchhoff diffraction integral is an exact formalism but typically doesn’t have a closed-form solution for an arbitrary grating profile. For example, if one is in the near field (Fresnel region) rather than far field, the diffraction pattern must be computed with Fresnel integrals, which lead to complicated oscillatory integrals (often expressed in terms of Fresnel S/C functions). These integrals generally don’t simplify to elementary functions except for special cases. Another edge case is if the grating has a complex structure (e.g. a blazed grating with a sawtooth profile, or a holographic grating with varying groove depths): solving Maxwell’s equations for the exact field requires matching boundary conditions in a spatially varying dielectric – something that typically can only be done numerically or with approximate coupled-wave theory. Analytical approaches break down when the geometry or spectra become too complicated (e.g. very large spectral bandwidth such that multiple diffraction orders overlap, or pulse durations so short that a simple Taylor expansion of $\phi(\omega)$ is insufficient).

Overlap of Diffraction Orders: If the input spectrum is extremely broad or the grating period is not sufficiently fine, different diffraction orders can overlap in angle. The grating equation indicates that orders are separated by roughly $\Delta\theta \sim \lambda/d$. At some wavelengths, the $m$-th order of a shorter wavelength might coincide with the $(m+1)$-th order of a longer wavelength. This overlapping of orders means the diffraction pattern from a broadband source can become ambiguous (different wavelengths’ contributions pile on top of each other). Indeed, higher spectral orders have a greater chance of overlapping with their neighbors. In such cases, additional filters or careful design (e.g. using only the first order, or blazed gratings to concentrate energy into one order) are required to isolate wavelengths. Overlapping orders are a scenario where the simple picture of non-interacting orders still holds (linearity ensures they do not perturb each other), but it complicates the interpretation of the output – an “edge case” consideration for spectrometer design.

### Numerical Methods

When analytical solutions are intractable, one must resort to numerical modeling of diffraction. A variety of computational techniques exist, including:
- Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis (RCWA): Also known as Fourier Modal Method, this solves Maxwell’s equations for periodic structures by expanding the field and permittivity in Fourier series. It yields the exact diffraction efficiencies for each order by solving a system of coupled-mode equations (essentially a numerical solution of the Helmholtz equation with the periodic boundary). RCWA is well-suited for gratings and can handle dielectric or metallic gratings with arbitrary groove shape, at the cost of heavy computation for very fine features.
- Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD): This is a time-domain simulation solving Maxwell’s curl equations on a grid. One can simulate a broadband pulse incident on a grating and watch the diffracted pulse evolve. FDTD naturally captures wide spectra and nonlinear effects (if present), but it requires significant computational resources for fine grating features (tiny spatial steps to resolve sub-wavelength structure) and long simulation time to get far-field results.
- Finite Element Method (FEM): By meshing the space and solving the Helmholtz equation as a boundary value problem (often with absorbing boundary conditions to simulate open space), FEM can handle complex geometries. For diffraction gratings, one would typically solve for the field in a unit cell with periodic boundary conditions on the sides and enforce an outgoing wave condition (like a Rayleigh expansion for $z \to \infty$)
    - FEM is flexible with material inhomogeneities and can yield highly accurate field distributions and efficiencies, albeit at high computational cost.
- Angular Spectrum or Fourier-Optics propagation: This is a semi-analytical numeric approach where one computes the Fourier transform of the field just after the grating (which may be done by FFT for a sampled aperture function) and then propagates it to the desired distance by multiplying by phase factors (free-space transfer function). Essentially, it numerically evaluates the Huygens/Fraunhofer integrals without a closed-form. This is efficient for propagating known aperture fields to the far field or intermediate field (adding quadratic phase factors for Fresnel propagation).

Each of these methods can handle pulses by either repeating the calculation for many frequency components (spectrum slicing) or by using time-domain simulation directly. Why use numerical methods? – Because for most real gratings (for instance, a reflection grating with a complex groove shape optimized for certain polarization and bandwidth), the electromagnetic boundary-value problem does not yield to simple formulas. Numerical solutions, while computationally intensive, can accommodate edge cases like surface plasmons on metallic gratings, finite grating size (truncation effects), very broadband incoherent sources, and so on. In summary, when the ideal assumptions are violated – e.g. not in the far field, extremely broadband with overlapping orders, complicated grating profiles – analytical solutions either don’t exist or become unwieldy, and one must simulate Maxwell’s equations directly to obtain the diffraction behavior.

## Thermal Radiation and Broadband Source Extensions

### Broadband Incoherent Sources

Thermal radiation (like light from a hot filament, the Sun, or any blackbody source) is a continuum of wavelengths and is usually incoherent (random phase relationships between different frequency components). The physics of its diffraction through a grating is the same linear process applied to a superposition of many waves. We can conceptually break the thermal emission into infinitesimal narrowband components, each of which diffracts according to the grating equation and produces its own pattern. Because thermal light has no fixed phase relation between different frequencies, the total diffracted intensity is essentially the sum of intensities of each wavelength component (interference between different wavelengths time-averages out). Thus, a diffraction grating illuminated by white thermal light will produce a continuous spectrum of colors in each diffracted order, often visible as a rainbow pattern. A familiar example is the colorful spectrum seen when sunlight reflects off a DVD or CD – the densely packed tracks act as a diffraction grating and separate the white light into rainbow colors. Each color appears at the angle given by the grating formula for that wavelength (for $m=\pm1$, etc.), and since all wavelengths from violet to red are present, one sees a full spread of angles filled in with color.

### Thermal Spectrum in Wave Equations

One might ask: how do Maxwell’s equations handle thermal radiation? The answer is through the concept of electromagnetic modes. In thermal equilibrium, each allowed mode of the electromagnetic field carries energy $k_B T$ on average (Rayleigh-Jeans law at low frequency, with Planck’s law introducing the quantum correction at high frequency). In a cavity, the normal mode solutions of Maxwell’s equations are standing waves, and their distribution leads to the blackbody spectrum. When a small opening in the cavity (or a hot object) emits radiation, it emits a combination of all these modes – a continuum of frequencies with statistical phase fluctuations. Maxwell’s equations are still obeyed by each mode. Therefore, when such a broadband mixture illuminates a diffraction grating, we can treat it by integrating the contributions of each mode/frequency. The fundamental wave equation does not change; we simply have a continuum of $\lambda$ to consider. The spectral irradiance of thermal radiation (given by Planck’s law) $I(\lambda)$ can be folded with the grating’s diffraction efficiency for each $\lambda$ to predict the outcome. For example, the intensity at a certain angle $\theta$ in order $m$ will be $I_{\text{out}}(\theta) = \int I(\lambda), T_m(\lambda), \delta(\sin\theta - m\lambda/d),d\lambda$ in an idealized sense, where $T_m(\lambda)$ is the grating’s efficiency for order $m$ and the delta-function enforces the grating equation condition. In practice, one would see a broad peak of each order containing the spectrum $I(\lambda)$ spread out. No new physics is needed to handle thermal light – one just must remember to average over the many uncorrelated waves rather than expecting a sharp interference fringe pattern. Coherent laser pulses can create sharp interference fringes between wavelengths (if, say, two discrete lines interfere), but an incoherent source will not create stable interference between different colors. It will still show interference within each narrow band (e.g. the finite slit width still produces a sinc-squared envelope on each order), but any fine fringes wash out when integrated over time.

### Extension to Radiative Transfer

Thermal emission typically spans a huge bandwidth (e.g. a blackbody at $T=5800$ K like the sun spans from UV to IR). Gratings working over such a range must be designed for broad dispersion and sometimes different grating equations in different spectral regions (since $d$ might be comparable to $\lambda$ in UV vs. IR, etc.). Nonetheless, the same formalism applies piecewise. In engineering terms, one could compute diffraction for a set of wavelengths across the spectrum and sum the results, weighted by the source’s spectral radiance. Because Maxwell’s equations are linear, there is no problem superposing the solutions for each wavelength. The results for thermal radiation can be verified by experiments and are in complete agreement with wave theory – for instance, the energy distribution in diffracted orders of a grating used in an IR spectrometer will follow the Planck law envelope. Importantly, gratings do not alter the spectral content of thermal light; they only redirect different parts of it. Thus, the entropy and brightness considerations from thermodynamics (like Kirchhoff’s law of thermal radiation) are not violated – a grating at equilibrium would emit the same spectrum as it receives, just scattered in angle.

In summary, thermal (incoherent) radiation diffracts through a grating in the same way as coherent light, except that one must integrate over a continuous spectrum and take an incoherent sum of intensities. The result is a smooth rainbow pattern rather than discrete lines or fringes. The theoretical treatment extends seamlessly: we still use the wave equation for each mode. Indeed, deriving the blackbody spectrum itself requires summing over electromagnetic modes (solutions of Maxwell’s equations), showing that even thermal radiation is fundamentally a superposition of many coherent mode fields. The diffraction grating simply acts on each of those mode components. Thus, all the equations we have discussed – from the grating equation to Fourier integrals – remain valid, with the understanding that we integrate over the continuous distribution of wavelengths of a thermal source.

## Conclusion

We have presented a detailed analysis of how a non-monochromatic wave pulse (with multiple frequency components) propagates and diffracts through a grating. Starting from Maxwell’s equations, we framed the problem with the wave/Helmholtz equation and applied it to the periodic boundary of a grating, obtaining analytical conditions for diffraction orders (the grating equation) and expressions via the Fourier transform for the diffracted field. Using a Fourier decomposition in time, we treated the broadband pulse as a superposition of monochromatic waves, each of which the grating diffracts independently. We examined how dispersion arises in this context – different wavelengths taking different paths leads to temporal separation (group delays) and pulse chirping, which can be quantified by expanding the frequency-dependent phase. In ideal cases (far-field, simple apertures) we obtained closed-form solutions, whereas in complicated scenarios we noted why analytical approaches fail and how one can resort to numerical simulation techniques to solve Maxwell’s equations directly. Finally, we extended the discussion to thermal radiation, highlighting that the same linear wave principles apply and explaining how to handle the continuous spectrum and incoherence of thermal sources. Throughout, the emphasis was on using fundamental wave physics (rather than purely geometric or heuristic arguments), providing a coherent mathematical description of diffraction of broadband pulses by a grating. The outcome is both a practical understanding (e.g. how a grating separates colors) and a theoretical one (how the wave equation, through superposition and boundary conditions, yields diffraction phenomena).
